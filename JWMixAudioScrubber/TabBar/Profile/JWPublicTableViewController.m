 Public table view controller is a space where users can search for another user, see the tracks they have uploaded, and download them to use in their own sessions.
 
 PTVC will interact with AWS Dynamo and AWS S3 to 1) list the jam tracks the user being queryied has uploaded and 2) download the selected jam track from the correct bucket once the user chooses their desired track for a new session.
