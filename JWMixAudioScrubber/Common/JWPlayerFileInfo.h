/*
 Given a track with durationRawTrack
 A clip from that track can be obtained using insets startPositionInset and endPositionInset
 
 startPositionInset - seconds into raw track to begin playback (Clip Left)
 endPositionInset - seconds into raw track from end playback will end (Clip Right)
 
 method calculateAtCurrentPosition will take a current position of all tracks
 startPosition is set to the start position when playback should start
 startPosition GREATER than currentPos  == the track has not begun play
 startPosition EQUAL to currentPos == the track begins to play
 startPosition LESS than currentPos == the track is being played
 startPosition + durationPlayback LESS than currentPos == track is done playing
 
 duration is computed by subtracting insets (both start and end)
 set These ...
 - trackStartPosition
 - trackDuration
 - startPositionInset
 - endPositionInset
 
 and get these (with currentPosition)
 - duration
 - remainingInTrack
 - currentPositionIntrack
 - startPositionInReferencedTrack
 - readPositionInReferencedTrack
 
 Use readPosition to read AudioFile at psotion for a duration
